Using two cameras located on the rim of the glasses, the cameras capture the eye movements, map the gaze point and embed it into the video. This wearable device has two streaming options: mobile or computer. The mobile option allows the user to view the live feedback directly from a Smartphone, and the computer option features real-time streaming and live synchronization with mobile EEG data (EEG sensor provided as an add-on).</p>

This technology contains dry and non-adhesive electrodes that continuously monitors the patient's heart rhythms. When a life-threatening rhythm is detected, the device will notify the user and give them enough time to seek help. If the patient becomes unconscious the device will release blue gel over the therapy electrodes and deliver an electrical shock to attempt to restore a regular heart rhythm.</p>
